Reading questions due before class
____________________________________

>In your own words, what is AJAX and why is it worth knowing about?

Its a protocol for fetching and storing information off the page and easily calling it from a server.  It can add a lot of functionality to a site with text/html/etc that you store on the server and can call on demand for browsers that support it.

>How do you download an html fragment and assign it to a variable?

$(document).ready(function() {
    $('#letter-a a').click(function() {
      var whatever = $('#dictionary').load('a.html');
       alert('Loaded!');
       return false;
  });
});


>What is JSON and why do we love it?

simplified format for associative arrays and simple data structures
great for moving information from a server to a web app

>What function do we use to download a JSON snippet from a server?

$.getJSON()  this parses the string and provides calling code for requesite object

>How can we provide a function to $.getJSON which allows us to act on the data after it finishes downloading?

// Unfinished code
   $(document).ready(function() {
     $('#letter-b a').click(function() {
       $.getJSON('b.json', function(data) {
       });
       return false;
  });
});

>What is the .val() function useful for? How does it compare to .html()?

gets the current value of the first element

>How do we specify an error callback for $.get?

$.get('file.php', requestData, function(data) {}

>What is JSONP and how do we use it to get around cross-origin policies?

lets you prepend some arbitrary text as padding in front of the JSON data
lets you retrieve info from remote server

What are the drawbacks of JSONP?

Browser will execute whatever the server returns.  Could be destructive or malicious.
