Reading questions due before class

When you think about testing javascript, what use cases come to mind?

Just about everything really.

Are they different from ruby?

Similar, not sure I know enough to make a large distinction... assertequal vs. equalTo

implementation seems similar on a basic level, I suspect its closer to rspec than minitest, but I haven't had a chance to use rspec yet to compare.

Is jasmine a unit test framework or an integration test framework?

Unit test

How do you set up a basic jasmine runner? What boilerplate is needed?

A describe function

and a link to your spec.js in the specrunner html

If it roughly corresponds with an individual test, what does describe correspond with?

the class?

How do you test equality?

.equalTo

What is the equivalent to setup/teardown?
