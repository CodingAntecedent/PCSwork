Reading questions due before class

What is an asynchronous event and why is this a problem that jasmine even needs to solve?

An event that doesn't resolve immediately when executed, jasmine needs to solve it because it may run all of its tests before an even is completed

How do you make jasmine wait for asynchronous events to happen?

waits(timeout)

If you didn’t want to actually make the ajax connection, how would you prevent jQuery from actually calling out to a server?

use a fake XMLHttpRequest

If you didn’t actually have a server, but you wanted ajax to continue, how could you do that with Sinon.js?

build a fake server

How does Sinon.js differ from Jasmine’s built in spies?

it can "bend" time, replace a server like a mock
