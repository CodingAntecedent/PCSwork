# Write a program that will take a number from 0 to 99 and spell out that number in English.

# In other words, if the input to the program is 22, then the output should be 'twenty-two'

# e.g.

class Say
  #will be set to each number in the input
  num1 = 0
  num2 = 0

  def analyze(num)
    num = num.to_i


    # gets the number and checks if they are i
  end

end
